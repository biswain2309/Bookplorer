# Contributing to Bookplorer
Let us make the contribution to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a defect/bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request.
6. Make all your PRs with the `develop` branch
7. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch and your pull request title must contain `[feat/bug]: your work short title`

Detailed guide can be find over [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

## Any contributions you make will be under MIT License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/sprakash57/Bookplorer/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/sprakash57/Bookplorer/issues)
Don't know how to create issue? [Follow this](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) doc to get the answer.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report , and We think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.But again this is an example you can follow your own.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This project has `eslint` and `prettier` to take care of linting and formatting. Once you are done with your changes, make sure you resolve all the linting issues and format the code as per the configuration.
